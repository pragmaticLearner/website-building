      The Mongolian invasion of Japan took place in 1274 and 1281, when the
      Mongol Empire attempted to invade Japan. The invasions were led by Kublai
      Khan, the grandson of Genghis Khan, who sought to conquer Japan as part of
      his efforts to expand the Mongol Empire. The first invasion was repelled
      by a severe typhoon, which the Japanese referred to as "divine wind" or
      "kamikaze." The second invasion was also unsuccessful due to logistical
      problems and strong Japanese resistance. In the end, the Mongolian
      invasions failed, and Japan was able to maintain its independence. (Text
